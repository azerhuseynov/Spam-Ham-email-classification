# Spam-Ham-email-classification

This data set consists of email subjects being spam or ham. Each email subject is labeled binarily (labeled by zeroes and ones). 
My  task is to build NLP model which predicts emails spamming.

1. Import emails dataset and get familiarized with it.
2. Add `id` column defined by number of rows
3. Prepare data for fitting to the model
4. Use cv.glmnet for modeling
